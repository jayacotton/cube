# cube
This is an animated floating cube displayed on an OLED display.

The graphics card is Quazar olded display.  The file liboled.c is derived from the oled.s code
published by Sam Coupe.

Most of the code in cube.c comes from 2 sources, Graphics Gems 1st edition, and for the line drawing
code Wikipedia, Bresenham's line algorithm.  The ramainder is code converted from an old floating
cube line art program that I wrote about 10 years ago.
